## Deimos - Collection of utilities for daemon creation

Deimos is a collection of some code I found useful to create some of my private projects.

At this time Deimos contains two helper libraries:

#### **Deimos.Logging** - Zero-config logging

Contains a very simple logging component. It's most important feature is that it needs absolutely no configuration.

#### **Deimos.Http** - A simple framework to create embedded HTTP servers

Supports creation of embedded HTTP servers to quickly create REST APIs or host simple web applications from a normal .NET process.
